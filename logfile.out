==11134== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably

==11134== 
==11134== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==11134==   /path/to/gdb ./minishell
==11134== and then give GDB the following command
==11134==   target remote | /Users/edos-san/.brew/Cellar/valgrind/HEAD-6ff08b6/libexec/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=11134
