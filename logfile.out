==50207== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==50207== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,

==50207== 
==50207== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==50207==   /path/to/gdb ./minishell
==50207== and then give GDB the following command
==50207==   target remote | /Users/amaria-m/.brew/Cellar/valgrind/HEAD-6ff08b6/libexec/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=50207
==50207== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
